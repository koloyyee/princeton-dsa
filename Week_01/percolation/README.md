## Summary

This is assignment gave me a chance to see how (weighted) quick union find algorithm is used in real life situtaion. It
is helpful when we are able to see the result visually.

It has bee a struggle for me to figure out how to implement the algorithm, but thankfully the assigment
[FAQ](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/faq.php) section
gave us some great hints. There is also a
wonderful [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o60oHXesOuA&ab_channel=JoshHug) which provides even better
help!

Overall this assignment gave a glimpse of how Quick Union Find algorithm works, but to further understand it is better
to learn by rewriting it myself.
